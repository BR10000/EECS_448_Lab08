            Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur, investor, and business magnate.
             He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO,
            and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company;
            and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth
            of around US$273 billion as of April 2022,[6] Musk is the wealthiest
            person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires
            Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.[7][8]
            Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White South African father,
            and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended
            the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age
            17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's
            University and transferred to the University of
            Pennsylvania two years later, where he received
            a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He
            moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
            University but decided instead to pursue a
            business career, co-founding the web softwar
            e company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal.
            The startup was acquired by Compaq for
            $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk
            co-founded online bank X.com, which merged
            with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The
            company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
